this is our commit-msg types

- chore: Update of tasks that do not cause changes to the production code, but changes to tools, configuration changes and libraries.
- feat: These are additions of new features or any other new implementations to the code.
- fix: Essentially define the handling of bug fixes.
- refactor: Used in any changes that are made to the code, but do not alter the final functionality of the impacted task.
- docs: Inclusion or modification of documentation files only.
- perf: A code change that improves performance.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests in automated testing processes (TDD).
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

this is an example: 
- `git commit -m 'chore: commit test'
